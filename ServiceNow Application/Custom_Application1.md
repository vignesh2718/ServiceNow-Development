# WeV Technology: Use Case Overview

## Introduction

WeV is a company specializing in AI-powered devices for construction workers, including safety drones, AR glasses, smart hats, and wearable environmental sensors. They receive orders from construction-based clients through various channels such as calls and emails. Currently, order processing is managed manually using spreadsheets, involving approval from a release management group before device dispatch.

## Current Process

- **Order Placement:** Clients submit orders via calls, emails, or other channels.
- **Order Processing:** Device management manually enters orders into spreadsheets.
- **Approval:** Device Management emails the release management group for approval.
- **Dispatch:** An outsourced team dispatches devices based on approvals.

## Challenges

- Manual order processing using spreadsheets is inefficient and prone to errors.
- Lack of a central system makes it challenging to track device location and maintain real-time client communication.
- Email-based approvals lead to delays in device delivery.
- Difficulty in collecting and analyzing client feedback for product improvement.

## Desired Outcome

- A centralized portal for clients to submit device requests.
- Streamlined and automated order processing system.
- Faster approvals and order fulfillment lead times.
- Automatic email notifications sent to clients.
- Centralized dashboard for managing operations and tracking.

## Steps for Application Development

### Process Flow:

1. **Client Order Placement:** Orders are submitted through an online portal.
2. **Review and Inventory Check:** Device management team reviews orders and checks inventory availability.
3. **Approval Request:** An approval request is sent to the release management group.
4. **Approval and Dispatch:** Upon approval, the application generates a dispatch order for the device.
5. **Client Notification:** Clients receive notifications regarding their order status.
6. **Automated Email Notifications:** Emails are triggered based on different conditions.
7. **Reporting and Dashboard:** Visualization of metrics through reports and dashboards.
