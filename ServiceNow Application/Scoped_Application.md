## Scoped Application

### What is a Scoped Application?

A scoped application in ServiceNow operates within a defined scope, isolating its data, functionality, and access controls from other applications in the instance. This isolation ensures that the application's components are contained and do not interfere with the core business services or other applications within the instance.

### Private Scope

- Each scoped app has a unique namespace, preventing naming conflicts with other scoped apps or global applications.
- Accessible only to authorized users, ensuring secure access controls.
- Does not disrupt core business services or functionalities of other applications.
- Other applications do not interfere with its normal functioning, maintaining stability.
- Scoped applications can be uploaded to the ServiceNow Store, allowing for distribution and sharing.
- Supports delegated development, enabling collaboration and modular development.

### Global Scope

- Global scope applications do not have a separate namespace and are accessible to all other global applications within the instance.
- Visible to all users with appropriate permissions, potentially impacting a larger number of users and existing processes.
- Changes to global applications can have broad implications, affecting various functionalities across the instance.
- Applications created in the global scope cannot be uploaded to the ServiceNow Store for broader distribution.

### Conclusion

Scoped applications provide a structured and secure way to develop and deploy custom applications within the ServiceNow platform. The use of namespaces and access controls ensures that scoped apps operate independently and securely, contributing to a more stable and scalable instance environment. Global scope applications, while more accessible, require careful management to avoid unintended impacts on the broader system.
