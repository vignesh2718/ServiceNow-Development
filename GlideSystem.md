# Understanding GlideSystem (gs)

## What is GlideSystem?

GlideSystem (often abbreviated as gs) is a tool or resource within a software system. It's like a set of functions or methods that help the system do various tasks. Imagine it as a Swiss Army knife for a software program.

## Information About the System and Current Logged-in User

**gs.yesterday();** - This is a method (a specific action or function) that helps you get information about yesterday's date.

## Types of GlideSystem Functions

Here are some different functions (or tools) you can use with GlideSystem:

1. **gs.info()**: This is like a way for the system to give you information. It's useful for getting details about what's happening in the system.

2. **gs.error()**: When something goes wrong in the system, this function helps you understand what the problem is. It's like a signal that something needs fixing.

3. **gs.log()**: This function is for keeping a record of events or actions in the system. It's useful for tracking what's been happening.

4. **gs.print()**: Just like printing out a document, this function allows the system to display information. It's helpful for showing things on the screen.

5. **gs.getUserDisplayName()**: This function helps you get the name of the user who is currently logged into the system. It's like finding out who's using the system at the moment.

6. **Implement gs.getUserID()**: This is a way to find out the unique identification number of the current user. It's like each user having their own special ID card.

7. **gs.getUserName()**: Similar to **gs.getUserDisplayName()**, this function helps you get the username of the person currently using the system.

8. **gs.getCurrentScopeName()**: This function tells you about the scope or area you're currently working in within the system. It's like knowing which room you're in within a big building.

9. **gs.getProperty()**: This function is for fetching properties or settings from the system. It's like asking the system for specific information it's stored.

Remember, you can use these functions to interact with the system and get useful information or perform actions. They're like tools in a toolbox, each serving a different purpose.
